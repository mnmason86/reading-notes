## Ethics in the Workplace

### [The employee backlash over Googleâ€™s censored search engine for China, explained](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/17/17704526/google-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-china)

As to the premise of this article, I agree whole-heartedly that workers should have a say on the use of the technologies they create, and have a right to be heard in regards to their concerns on the topics of ethics and morality. I would not personally want my work to aid an authoritarian government in the suppression or subjugation of its people. I am interested to read more about the laws surrounding 'value to stakeholders', as well as the *Accountable Capitalism Act*, and the impact those laws have on moral and ethical decisions. There is one point of pain in the article for me, which I expect to see in any article I read about large US corporations: that corporations should be treated as 'citizens'. While I disagree that any company should have the same rights as a living, breathing human, it does leave room for that company's employees to make more demands of their employer.

### [Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/)

I will start off by saying that I wonder how this article would hold up today, post-pandemic? It was written five years ago, and many of the issues discussed have certainly been exacerbated by the events of the last half-decade. I think this article brings up what is possibly the greatest dilemma of our time - true freedom of thought and action. We are so absorbed in what we see in digital advertising and 'suggestions', that we are subconsciously losing our own identities and freedoms. It was Thomas Jefferson's vision that the Constitution should be revised or re-written every 19-20 years, and if there was ever a time to consider this strongly, it is now.
